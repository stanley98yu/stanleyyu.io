Hi, I'm Stanley. I'm a student at [Columbia][columbia] studying computer science. In the past, I've worked on software engineering at [Butterfly Network][bfly] and research at [Cornell Tech][cornell] and [NASA][nasa]. If you're in the New York area and want to chat about anything, feel free to [reach out][email].
