Hi, I'm Stanley. I study computer science at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia</a>. In past lives, I was a research consultant and special needs volunteer. I enjoy spending my free time swimming, playing <a href="https://www.starcraft2.com">Starcraft II</a>, and publicizing my love for my two cats, Yuki and Mochi. If you're in the New York area and want to chat about anything, feel free to reach out.
